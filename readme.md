== Description ==
This was a redesign of my portfolio website.  The idea behind this design was to have it be responsive as well as more design-oriented and appealing to the user.  Another big implimentation for this design was the blog-post stylings as well as user comments and how they are displayed.

= Quick Specs =

1. The main content max-width is 1280px.
2. Media such as videos are set to have a max-width of 700px and should be within paragraph tags (for alignment purposes).
3. Blog post images are 70% wide.
4. The predominant font used throughout is "Proxima-nova", however others used include "Private-sans-web" and "Source-sans-pro".
