When generating a blog post via the text editor in Wordpress, remember these things...
	1.	Remove the inline "height" style that is already attached to the <img> tag so that the image scales properly in the browser.
	2.	Remember when aligning the image that you have three options for doing so...
		a)	alignleft
		b)	aligncenter
		c)	alignright
	3.	Remember that images will function the same way when within anchor links, so fear not!
	4.	When posting snippets of code, be sure to place inside <pre><code></pre></code> to get the full effects of Prism.js.  Also if you want to have the code snippets denote which language is being used, implement the following classes on <code></code>...
		a)	HTML / Markup		-->			<code class="language-markup"></code>
		b)	CSS 					-->			<code class="language-css"></code>
		c)	PHP					-->			<code class="language-php"></code>
	5.	When using the markup language with Prism for a code snippet, it is important to replace all opening " < " with " &lt; " so that opening and closing tags are displayed in the snippet.
	6.	For readability purposes, add two spaces before the first and last line of code in a code snippet!
